# Nockchain Launcher

This is a clean terminal UI to build, run, and monitor your Nockchain miners. It handles wallets, builds, updates, systemd services, and provides real-time system stats. Designed to be accessible for all experience levels.

---

## Requirements

- Ubuntu/Debian-based OS (or any Linux with `bash` and `systemd`)
- `make`, `screen`, and standard build tools
- Optional: `fzf` (used for interactive menus, installed automatically if missing)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. (Optional) Update your system and install curl (only once)
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install curl -y
```

### 2. Download the launcher script
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jobless0x/nockchain-launcher/main/nockchain_launcher.sh
chmod +x nockchain_launcher.sh
```

### 3. Run the launcher
```bash
./nockchain_launcher.sh
```

Thatâ€™s it, follow the menu to set up or launch miners.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- Builds Nockchain client from source
- Generates or detects your wallet (.env)
- Launches multiple miners based on system capacity
- Full systemd integration (auto-restart, logs, service isolation)
- Interactive menus using fzf
- Color-coded miner uptime and sync monitoring
- Live system stats: CPU load, memory, uptime
- Export state.jam from any miner via safe duplication
- Customizable peer topology: isolated, central, mesh, or manual
- Configurable miner flags through launch.cfg
- Detects and handles software updates automatically

---

## Systemd Basics

Each miner runs as a systemd service (named `nockchain-miner1`, `nockchain-miner2`, etc.). Here's how to manage them:

### Check service status
```bash
systemctl status nockchain-miner1
```

### View logs (live)
```bash
tail -f ~/nockchain/miner1/miner1.log
```

### Stop a miner
```bash
sudo systemctl stop nockchain-miner1
```

### Start a miner
```bash
sudo systemctl start nockchain-miner1
```

### Restart a miner
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nockchain-miner1
```

## Exporting a `state.jam`

To generate a snapshot of your miner state:

1. Select "Export state.jam" from the main menu.
2. Choose the source miner.
3. A safe duplicate of the miner will be created.
4. The exported file is saved to:

```bash
~/nockchain/state.jam
```

It will be auto used by all miner starting or restarting.

---

## Editing Configuration

All miner setup is saved in:

```bash
~/launch.cfg
```

Each `[minerX]` block includes:

- `MINING_KEY`
- `BIND_FLAG`, `PEER_FLAG`, `MAX_ESTABLISHED_FLAG`
- `STATE_FLAG`

You can safely edit this file to customize peers, ports, and state behavior.

---

## Editing Launcher Settings

You can change the core launcher settings at any time (user, install directory, or binary path):

- Select **Option 23** from the main menu ("Edit launcher settings")
- Choose which setting to edit:  
  - `NOCKCHAIN_USER`: which Linux user runs miners  
  - `NOCKCHAIN_HOME`: install/data directory  
  - `NOCKCHAIN_BIN`: path to your Nockchain binary
- The launcher shows the current value for each.  
- Press **Enter** to keep the current value, or type a new one to change.

Changes are saved instantly to `~/.nockchain_launcher.conf` and used next run.

## Useful Paths

| Purpose           | Path                             |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Miners            | ~/nockchain/minerX/              |
| Miner logs        | ~/nockchain/minerX/minerX.log    |
| Config            | ~/launch.cfg                     |
| State Export      | ~/nockchain/state.jam            |
| Settings          | ~/.nockchain_launcher.conf       |

---

## Pro Tips

- Run this to inspect running miner commands:
  ```bash
  ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd | grep nockchain
  ```
- `fzf` menus make stopping/restarting miners intuitive
- You can run the launcher again anytime, it won't overwrite existing miners unless you ask it to
